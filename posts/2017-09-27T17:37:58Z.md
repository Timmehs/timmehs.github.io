title: "Generating posts"

I wrote a shell script.  Since writing .sh is as horrible as it is useful, I deemed it worth the practice.  Here's what I came up with:

```bash
  #!/bin/bash

  # Create the file with timestamp
  timestamp=$(date -u "+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
  new_post_file="./posts/$timestamp.md"
  touch $new_post_file

  # Capture first argument (title) and remove from arg list
  title=$1
  shift

  # Build tags list:
  # Set Internal Field Separator to Comma so we can join the remaining args
  IFS=,
  join_tags=$*

  cat <<- EOF > $new_post_file
  title: $title
  tags: $join_tags
  date: $timestamp
  ----

  write content here

  EOF

  nvim $new_post_file
```

Running `scripts/post "Generating Posts" bash shell timestamps` gave me the following

```ruby
title: Generating posts
tags: bash,shell,timestamps
date: 2017-09-27T17:37:58Z
----

write content here
```

The idea is the javascript will parse the header to pull out pertinent data for building the header (markdown alone wont let me right-align the date, for one).  This takes a page out of jekyll's book by having a "header" section with key data points.  The top of the document will be parsed into a POJO, and everything after the `----` will be parsed from markdown to jsx.  And so, a blog post is born.

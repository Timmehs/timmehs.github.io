I wrote a shell script.  Since writing .sh is as horrible as it is useful, I deemed it worth the practice.  Here's what I came up with:

```
  1 #!/bin/bash
  2
  3 # Create the file with timestamp
  4 timestamp=$(date -u "+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
  5 new_post_file="./posts/$timestamp.md"
  6 touch $new_post_file
  7
  8 # Capture first argument (title) and remove from arg list
  9 title=$1
 10 shift
 11
 12 # Build tags list:
 13 # Set Internal Field Separator to Comma so we can join the remaining args
 14 IFS=,
 15 join_tags=$*
 16
 17 cat <<- EOF > $new_post_file
 18 title: $title
 19 tags: $join_tags
 20 date: $timestamp
 21 ----
 22
 23 write content here
 24
 25 EOF
 26
 27 nvim $new_post_file
 ```

Running `scripts/post "Generating Posts" bash shell timestamps` gave me the following

```
title: Generating posts
tags: bash,shell,timestamps
date: 2017-09-27T17:37:58Z

write content here
```

The idea is the javascript will parse the header to pull out pertinent data for building the header (markdown alone wont let me right-align the date, for one).  This takes a page out of jekyll's book by having a "header" section with key data points.  The top of the document will be parsed into a POJO, and everything after the `---------------------------` will be parsed from markdown to jsx.  And so, a blog post is born.

I decided to try my hand at building a "jekyll"-like, dynamically generated static website using webpack and React.  Is it overkill?  Maybe (Yes).  Is it proving fun?  Yes.

Here's a brief list of the features/goals/challenges that this site represents:
  * Keep asset size low. (React 16 was released today which minifies to ~32% smaller along with many other features and optimizations)
  * Parse markdown files into blog posts
  * Leverage "server side rendering" methods to generate the static site efficiently where reasonable.
  * Pipe dream of bundling this up into a modest static site builder like jekyll, with
    * Very little to no scaffolding (eschewing jekyll's reliance on tethering yourself to a theme)
    * Sass, React, and ES6 transpilation.
    * Post generator that adds a timestamped markdown file to `./posts` which is then parsed into JSX
  * Probably most importantly, I'd love to get more stuff out of my brain and into blog posts on a regular basis.

This takes a page out of jekyll\'s book by having a "header" section with key data points.

Here's where I landed.\n\n### Early days\nOriginally I had scripts to parse all files under my `/posts` directory and build `/assets/blog-manifest.json` which consisted of something like:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = [..JSONified blog post data...]\n```\n\nI had to call this script explicitly with `yarn build` which string this script together with webpack, something like `./bin/build-blog; webpack`.\nMy Blog component could then import this data, which was in a sensible enough form to map into a list of Post components to render the blog.\n\n### Leveraging webpack\nThe first step I took in the right direction was to extract that script to be a webpack plugin called `BlogBuilderPlugin`, which automatically built the `blog-manifest.json` file when the compilation was finished.  This ensured at least that whenever webpack rebuilt the bundle, there would be a fresh `blog-manifest.json` for the Blog to consume.  However, I wanted the blog to be rebuilt and reloaded as I was typing up posts.\n\n> The plugin wasn't quite what I needed, however.\n\nWhat I needed was to apply my special parsing of my post files, splitting apart `title`, `date`, `tags`, `markdown` into consumable modules.  But I needed to dynamically import ALL post files in order to render, sort, filter, etc.  I can't be expected to add an import statement for every blog post.  I'm going to be writing waaaay too many to be bothered with that (smirk).\n\nAll I needed to do in the end was add a custom `post-loader` with a rule to apply it to all .md files.  I should probably change it to .post since its not technically an md file.\n\nHere's the loader:\n```\nvar yaml = require('js-yaml')\n\n// Post Loader\n// Convert post.md file to object { date, markdown, title, tags }\nfunction parsePost(rawString) {\n  const splitContent = rawString.split(\"----\\n\")\n  const data = yaml.safeLoad(splitContent[0])\n  const tags = Object.assign(...data.tags.split(',').map(k => ({ [k]: true })))\n\n  return {\n    ...data,\n    tags,\n    markdown: splitContent.slice(1).join('')\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = function(source) {\n  return \"module.exports = \" + JSON.stringify(parsePost(source));\n};\n```\n\nAnd included in `webpack.config.js`:\n```javascript\n  ...\n    module: {\n      rules: [\n        {\n          test: /\\.md$/,\n          use: [\n            \"post-loader\"\n          ]\n        },\n    ...\n```\n\nThis loader will run for any .md file imported by code in my load path (through index.js).  The problem remains, how to load up ALL of these files at once.  Turns out there are dozens of \"glob\"ing packages on NPM to enable statements like this:\n\n```\n\nimport * as blogPosts from '../../posts/*.md'\n\n```\n\nI happened to use a babel plugin called [babel-plugin-import-glob](https://github.com/novemberborn/babel-plugin-import-glob), but there are many others.\n\nThats probably not a coherent narrative, but the TL;DR is:\n\nI have a reasonably clean platform, all handled through ES6 modules and webpack, to dynamically generate and render blog posts.\n\nNext up:\n\n* Blog index and filtering using dates and tags.\n"}},function(e,t){e.exports={title:"Gitalong: A better Github feed",tags:["express","webpack","react","github"],date:"2017-10-14T22:36:36.000Z",header:"https://d1u0z01nzsqzn7.cloudfront.net/images/octocat.svg",markdown:"\n\nTwo years ago I started kicking around a little project called Gitalong. A user could log in and see a feed of Github repos from all the people they were connected with (following/followed).  This could be sorted by last pushed-to, or the number of stars it had.\n\nIt could also be filtered by language, and it turned out this was a pretty neat way to get a view of what was happening in your Github social circle.  It let you see what your peers were actually working on and pushing to, at least publically.  Cool!\n\nThe Rails app that drove this was not that cool however.  By that I mean it was an elaborate cluster****.  The data flow went something like this:\n\n- User logs in, authenticating with their Github profile.\n- Redirect to '/', so the server needs to build the activity feed:\n  - Get the list of \"following\" users from Github\n  - Get the list of \"followers\" users from Github\n  - For each user in this combined list, get the first page of their Repos\n  - Serialize the list of users and the list of repos and put in a JSON response\n\nEven for a user like myself who only modestly consumes Github's social features (I follow about ~20 people, and am followed by mostly those folks, so grand total is about 25), this meant a sizeable number of requests.\n\nWaiting for dozens of requests to process singlefile (in ruby) wasn't really an option, so I used the following strategies:\n- Sidekiq jobs to wrap the API and DB calls as a way to get some concurrency/async functionality to process the requests and db updates.\n- For fun, I used Rails 5's new ActionCable feature to 'livestream' the data to the client as the data came back from Github.  It was rad watching React components get data from a websocket connection, and fairly easy to set up.  Excited to try this out again for a DIFFERENT application however.\n\nIn this way, eventually, a feed was constructed and the user could then filter it.  I never polished up and finished the project.  When I walked away from it there were plenty of bugs and UI issues that needed addressing, but it just felt like it was the wrong tech stack for it.  For an application with a specific, single purpose, it just felt wrong to have an entire Rails app spun up, complete with websocket server, psql db, and redis job queue.\n\nBut I didn't forget how cool it was to browse Github data like that; to see a stream of what folks I knew were up to in their coding endeavors (on Github).  So recently I decided to reboot the project in Express as an excuse to dive a bit deeper into Nodejs (even doing some Nodejs units on Pluralsight.com).\n\nSo far its been extremely rewarding and exciting to see the kinds of things a node backend really kicks ass at.  It also feels great to step out of Rails' convention-over-configuration and have to think critically about organizating an application.  I'm sure a number of blogposts about my learnings will follow before the project is done, possible topics:\n* ### Organizing an Express/React app in the age of Webpack\n* ### \"Productivity: function first, design later\"  Or, \"fighting against every impulse in my soul\".\n* ### Wrangling a ton of async requests with Promise.all\n"}},function(e,t){e.exports={title:"BuddhaBlog",tags:["blog","open-source","framework"],date:"2019-04-14T21:26:25.000Z",header:"https://d1u0z01nzsqzn7.cloudfront.net/images/forest_path.jpg",markdown:"\n\nWell its been almost two years since my last post and there's just too much to cover, so I'll gloss over some big news: I've ended an amazing 4-year run at [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com).

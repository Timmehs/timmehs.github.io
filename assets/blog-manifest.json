Is it overkill?  Maybe (Yes).  Is it proving fun?  Yes.\n\nHere's a brief list of the features/goals/challenges that this site represents:\n* Keep asset size low. (React 16 was released today which minifies to ~32% smaller along with many other features and optimizations)\n* Parse markdown files into blog posts\n* Leverage \"server side rendering\" methods to generate the static site efficiently where reasonable.\n* Pipe dream of bundling this up into a modest static site builder like jekyll, with:\n* very little to no scaffolding (eschewing jekyll's reliance on tethering yourself to a theme)\n* Sass, react, and ES6 transpilation.\n* Post generator that adds a timestamped markdown file to `./posts` which is then parsed into JSX\n* Probably most importantly, I'd love to get more stuff out of my brain and into blog posts on a regular basis.\n"}]
